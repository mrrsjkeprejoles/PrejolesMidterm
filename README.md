# REACT JS

## What is React JS?

React.js is a JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces using reusable components. It features a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, declarative syntax with JSX, and supports single-page applications, enhancing performance and user experience.

### Purposes of React JS:
- **Building User Interfaces:** React simplifies creating complex, dynamic interfaces for web applications by breaking them into reusable components.
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** It enables smooth, fast-loading SPAs by handling in-browser routing without page reloads.
- **Efficient Updates with Virtual DOM:** React’s virtual DOM allows for optimized rendering by updating only the changed parts of the UI, improving performance.
- **State Management:** With tools like hooks and context, React manages data changes in components seamlessly.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** React’s component-based architecture supports native mobile app development via React Native.

## How to Install React JS?

Now that you know what React is and why it's useful, you'll learn how to make use of this library in your project.

**STEP 1: Install Node.js**
Before you start the React installation process, you must have Node.js installed on your computer. 

You have to install Node first because React.js is a JavaScript library, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. So when you're writing React, you include JavaScript functions in your React project, and then Node.js helps run this JavaScript code on the web page.

Node.js has various versions. The recommended version is the latest stable version, as it contains major and significant changes. These changes includes bug fixes and security updates, compatibility with your project dependencies, and so on.

To install Node, navigate to the Node.js website. On their webpage, you have the option to download either the recommended version or the current version.
