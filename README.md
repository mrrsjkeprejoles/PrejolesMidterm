# REACT JS

## What is React JS?

React.js is a JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces using reusable components. It features a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, declarative syntax with JSX, and supports single-page applications, enhancing performance and user experience.

### Purposes of React JS:
- **Building User Interfaces:** React simplifies creating complex, dynamic interfaces for web applications by breaking them into reusable components.
- **Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** It enables smooth, fast-loading SPAs by handling in-browser routing without page reloads.
- **Efficient Updates with Virtual DOM:** React’s virtual DOM allows for optimized rendering by updating only the changed parts of the UI, improving performance.
- **State Management:** With tools like hooks and context, React manages data changes in components seamlessly.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** React’s component-based architecture supports native mobile app development via React Native.

## How to Install & Set Up React JS?

Now that you know what React is and why it's useful, you'll learn how to make use of this library in your project.

Before installing React JS, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn). You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for React development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Download and install Node.js from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
2. **Create a New React Application**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-custom-react-app
     ```
   - This command creates a new React project named `my-custom-react-app`. It installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the project structure.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-custom-react-app

4. **Run the React App**
   - Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - This will open your app in the browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

5. **Edit Your React App**
   - Open the project in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - You can modify files within the `src` folder to customize your app.

   ### With these steps, you have a fully functional React environment ready for development!
